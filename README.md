# Product-Analysis
In this project our objective was to find out what was the feature that people liked the most in our product. The first task was to get a dataset that was not pre processed tempered. I wanted to be sure that our result is unbiased so we directly took comments from amazon, made a text file out of it and used it as our dataset.
I intended to find the sentiment score of this product. The sentiment score is the total number of positive and negative comments separately.
I wanted to find the feature that people liked the most and the least as well so that we can work on the least liked feature and improve it in the launch of the next smartphone.
I also used the visualization techniques to understand our product reach.
